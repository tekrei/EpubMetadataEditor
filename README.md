# A simple Epub Metadata Editor
Just a simple Epub Metadata editor for learning GTK 3 in Python.

It is tested only in Debian GNU/Linux.

## Required Libraries
- [ebooklib](https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib): `pip install ebooklib`
- It is developed using Python v3 and Gtk v3

## Possible improvements
* If it is possible: just updating the metadata of the file instead of reading the epub file, changing the metadata and writing the file again
* Updating all metadata of selected book using a form instead of updating each metadata value separately
* Recursively finding and listing all epub files of the selected folder
